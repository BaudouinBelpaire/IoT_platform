# Wireless Sensor Network.
This project consists on design a small sensor network based on interconnected [ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/0a-esp8266ex_datasheet_en.pdf) micro-controllers.

## Initial Project 
The sensor network represents when someone sits in or stands up from a chair, the sensor network will send an alert (via MQTT). Each chair will have pressure mats—basically binary switch sensors—under it, and each mat will be interfaced with an ESP8266 to run the programme. For the objective of this assignment, a straightforward push button will be installed in lieu of each pressure mat. Assume that every ESP8266 connected to a mat (sensor node) will be supplied with power to rechargeable energy source. But the bridge node, one of the ESP8266s, won't be connected to a pressure mat, and a USB port will supply power. More specifically, it will be linked to a gateway (such as a laptop) and using the serial port to communicate with it.
